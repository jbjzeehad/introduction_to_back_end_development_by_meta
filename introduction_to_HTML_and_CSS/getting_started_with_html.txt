Tags: opening tag, closing tag
there ae many tags available in HTML. here we will learn about common tags that we will use as a developer.

Headings-Headings allow you to display titles and subtitles on your webpage.

<body>
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>
</body>

Paragraphs-Paragraphs contain text content.

<p>
   This paragraph
   contains a lot of lines
   but they are ignored.
</p>

Line Breaks-As you've learned, line breaks in the paragraph tag line are ignored by HTML. Instead, they must be specified using the <br> tag. The <br> tag does not need a closing tag.

<p>
   This paragraph<br>
   contains a lot of lines<br>
   and they are displayed.
</p>

Strong-Strong tags can be used to indicate that a range of text has importance.

<p>
   No matter how much the dog barks: <strong>don't feed him chocolate</strong>.
</p>

Bold-Bold tags can be used to draw the reader's attention to a range of text.

<p>
   The primary colors are <b>red</b>, <b>yellow</b> and <b>blue</b>.
</p>

Bold tags should be used to draw attention but not to indicate that something is more important.

Emphasis-Emphasis tags can be used to add emphasis to text.

<p>
   Wake up <em>now</em>!
</p>

Italics-Italics tags can be used to offset a range of text.

<p>
   The term <i>HTML</i> stands for HyperText Markup Language.
</p>

Emphasis vs. Italics-By default both tags will have the same visual effect in the web browser. The only difference is the meaning.
Emphasis tags stress the text contained in them.
Italics represent off-set text and should be used for technical terms, titles, a thought or a phrase from another language

Lists-There are two types of lists in HTML.

Lists can be unordered using the <ul> tag. List items are specified using the <li> tag

<ul>
   <li>Tea</li>
   <li>Sugar</li>
   <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

Lists can also be ordered using the <ol> tag

<ol>
   <li>Rocky</li>
   <li>Rocky II</li>
   <li>Rocky III</li>
</ol>

Div tags-A <div> tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS.

<div>
   <p>This is a paragraph inside a div</p>
</div>

It can be nested inside other elements

<div>
   <div>
      <p>This is a paragraph inside a div thatâ€™s inside another div</p>
   </div>
</div>

As mentioned, the div has no impact on content unless it is styled by CSS

Comments- you want to leave a comment in the code for other developers, it can be added as:

<!-- This is a comment --> 

The comment will not be displayed in the web browser.
