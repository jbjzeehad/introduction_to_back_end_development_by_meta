>> Bootstrap :  is often described as a way to "build fast, responsive sites" and it is a "feature-packed, powerful, and extensible frontend toolkit".
Bootstrap is a library of CSS and JavaScript code that you can combine to quickly build visually appealing websites.
Modern web development is all about components. Small pieces of reusable code that allow you to build websites quickly. Bootstrap comes with multiple components for very fast construction of multiple components, or parts of components.
Another important aspect of modern development is responsive grids which allow web pages to adapt their layout and content depending on the device in which they are viewed. Bootstrap comes with a pre-made set of CSS rules for building a responsive grid.
Bootstrap is very popular amongst developers as it saves development time and provides a way for developers to build visually appealing prototypes and websites.
Bootstrap saves significant time because all the CSS code that styles its grid and pre-built components is already written. Instead of having to have a high level of expertise in various CSS concepts, you can just use the existing Bootstrap CSS classes to produce nicely-looking websites. This is indispensable when you need to quickly iterate on website layouts.
Once you know how Bootstrap works, youâ€™ll have enough knowledge to tweak its styling and a whole new world of development opens up to you.

>> Bootstrap is a collection of pre written code chunks in css and javascript.
Bootstrap modifiers add a CSS class to change the visual style of components. You will use an infix to indicate the breakpoint in Bootstrap CSS rules.

>> Bootstrap alerts : 
    primary alerts display in blue
    Danger alerts display in red

>> Bootstrp Grid : 
    - 12 columns.
    - container, rows, columns.

>> Using Bootstrap documentation :
Bootstrap comes with detailed documentation on setting up and using the features available in its library. The documentation is clear and has many code examples to help you get started.

In this reading, you'll explore the frequently used documentation sections.

The documentation for Bootstrap is currently available at the following link.

https://getbootstrap.com/docs

- Navigating the documentation: The sidebar on the webpage allows you to navigate through the different sections of the documentation. There is also a search box if you need to search for a specific piece of information.
- Layout: The layout section of the documentation describes how to use the grid system of Bootstrap. This covers what you've learned so far and includes more advanced usage such as offsets, column alignment, auto-layout and variable width columns.
- Content: The content section of the documentation describes Bootstrap's default text styling and how to use responsive images and tables. You've learned the basics of these earlier on and this section goes into further detail.
- Forms: The forms section of the documentation describes how to build forms using Bootstrap's styles. The library has many CSS rules to improve your form's user interface and experience. Below are some features you'll frequently use as a developer:
- Form Styling: Bootstrap includes CSS rules to improve the visual style of input elements.
- Switches: If you've used an app on your mobile device, you're probably familiar with the switch input type.
Bootstrap includes CSS rules to style checkbox input elements as switches. 
- Input Groups: Input groups are useful for providing additional content to the input field. For example, if you wanted to request the user to input a US dollar amount, you can use an input group to show the dollar symbol and cents amount.
-Floating Labels:
Floating labels help provide form information to the user as part of the input itself. These are different from regular form placeholders. The information stays visible if the user is interacting with the element or if the element has content.
- Components:
As you have learned, Bootstrap comes with many pre-made UI elements and styles to help speed up your development.
Some of these components require Javascript to work, while others only require CSS classes applied to HTML elements. The Components section of the documentation explains these requirements on each component page and provides many code examples.

- Tailwind CSS
- UIKit
- MVP.css

>> Question and Answer :
- To reference a JS or file in an html document you use the script tag.The script tag is used to reference a JavaScript script or file.
- if your application requires a library or framework to run this is called a dependency. Libraries and frameworks are dependencies of your application.
-  A responsive breakpoint is the point at which a website's content and design will adapt in order to provide the best user experience.
- The container element is the base element for using the Bootstrap grid. The bootstrap grid system always start with container element.
- Modifiers are used for components. Infixes are used for the responsive breakpoints
